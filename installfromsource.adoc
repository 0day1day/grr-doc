= Installing from source: Prebuilt dependencies =

To build GRR from source you first need to make sure you have the necessary
dependencies.  The easy way to get them is to install them as packages using the
link:quickstart.adoc[quickstart] script.

Once you've done that, installing the latest GRR is easy.

Get the source:
-------------------------------------------------
git clone https://github.com/google/grr.git
-------------------------------------------------

Build and install:
-------------------------------------------------------
cd grr
python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install
-------------------------------------------------------

This will install GRR into e.g.
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/grr-0.2-py2.7.egg/

Then restart:

---------------------------------------------------
source shell_helpers.sh
grr_restart_all
---------------------------------------------------

The hard way is to do it all from
scratch using the link:serverfromscratch.adoc[server from scratch] instructions.
